# CLAUDE.md — operational playbook for this repo

This file is auto-loaded when working in `pais-sdk-cli`. Read this before changing code.

## What this is

Python SDK + `pais` CLI for **VMware Private AI Service (PAIS)**, with a bundled mock server (`pais_mock`) for offline development. Public on GitHub: <https://github.com/dshahnaz/pais-sdk-cli>. Latest tag: `v0.6.5` (see `pyproject.toml`/`__version__` for current).

## Layout (one-pager)

- `src/pais/` — SDK
  - `client.py` — `PaisClient` facade
  - `resources/*.py` — one file per PAIS resource group (knowledge_bases, indexes, agents, …)
  - `models/*.py` — contract-first pydantic models, shared with the mock; **all status fields are `str`** (not Enum) per the doc contract — Enum classes kept as named constants
  - `transport/{base,httpx_transport,fake_transport}.py` — Transport protocol + 2 impls
  - `auth/{base,none,bearer,oidc_password}.py` — pluggable auth strategies
  - `ingest/registry.py` + `ingest/splitters/*.py` — splitter plug-in system (4 built-ins, each with `SplitterMeta`)
  - `ingest/runner.py` — generic ingest pipeline (worker pool, JSON report)
  - `cli/app.py` — `pais` typer entrypoint (interactive shell on bare `pais` in TTY)
  - `cli/interactive.py` — interactive shell menu loop + flat command fallback
  - `cli/_landing.py` — smart landing screen (env state + recommended workflow)
  - `cli/_introspect.py` — walks typer command tree for the shell menu
  - `cli/_pickers.py` — context-aware ref pickers (pick_kb, pick_index, pick_agent, pick_or_create_* variants, with ★ recents + `← back`)
  - `cli/_prompts.py` — type-aware prompt builders for the shell
  - `cli/_recent.py` — per-profile LRU cache of recently-used aliases
  - `cli/_config_writeback.py` — safe append-only TOML writeback (workflows save aliases to `pais.toml`)
  - `cli/_splitter_preview.py` — dry-run splitter against a file (tokens + chars)
  - `cli/_workflows/` — 7 task-centric workflows (setup_agent, ingest_data, setup_kb, bootstrap_toml, chat, search, cleanup)
  - `cli/_flags.py` — shared `typer.Option` constants with long+short forms
  - `cli/{ingest_cmd,ensure_cmd,config_cmd,status_cmd,shell_cmd,doctor_cmd,logs_cmd}.py` — subcommands
  - `cli/{_alias,_kb_show,_config_file,_profile_config,_output}.py` — helpers
  - `dev/{markdown,split_suite,token_budget,ingest}.py` — legacy helpers; `cli/dev.py` is a removal-redirect shim (console-script entry removed in v0.5.0)
  - `config.py` — pydantic-settings: env > config-file profile > .env > defaults
  - `errors.py` (includes `IndexDeleteUnsupported`), `logging.py`
- `src/pais_mock/{server,state,behaviors}.py` — FastAPI mock + in-memory `Store`; emits doc-aligned wire shapes (`{chunks: [...]}` for search, `{deleted: true}` for KB/agent delete)
- `tests/` — 309 tests across contract, transport, auth, resources, CLI, ingest, alias resolver, ensure, interactive, workflows, pickers, landing, recent, config writeback, splitter meta/preview, search doc shape, index delete, cleanup verify, doctor, logs, relaxed enums. Coverage gate: ≥ 85 % on touched modules.
- `docs/` — `ingestion.md`, `architecture.md`, `migration-0.3-to-0.4.md`, `v0.4-plan.md`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — matrix Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12

## Verified PAIS API constraints (don't re-discover)

> **🔗 Authoritative API doc**: <https://developer.broadcom.com/xapis/vmware-private-ai-service-api/latest/> — **WebFetch this at the start of every plan-mode session that touches PAIS endpoints.** Reconcile every shape against the live spec before design. The user has reinforced this rule twice (v0.4 chunk_size units, v0.6 agent index_id shape) — don't be the third reminder.

These shape the design — never assume otherwise without re-checking the docs:

1. `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` are **tokens**, not characters.
2. **No documented per-document DELETE**, no batch DELETE, no cancel-indexing endpoint. Cleanup ops use a probe-then-fallback pattern (`DELETE /…/documents/{id}` or `DELETE /active-indexing` first; on 404/405, delete-and-recreate the index — which **changes the index_id**).
3. **No metadata / tag fields on documents.** The only durable label is `origin_name` (the uploaded filename).
4. **No metadata-filtered search.** Filtering happens client-side or in the agent prompt.
5. The user's prod PAIS is internal-network, no-auth (`PAIS_AUTH=none`), self-signed TLS (`PAIS_VERIFY_SSL=false`).
6. **Agent → KB binding** is `index_id` (str, an index UUID) + `index_top_n` (int) directly on `POST /compatibility/openai/v1/agents`. The legacy `tools=[ToolLink(tool_id=mcp_uuid)]` shape in our SDK still works on some deployments and is preserved for back-compat — but **prefer `index_id` for new code**.
7. **`data_origin_type`** accepts `"DATA_SOURCES"` (plural, per the doc). Our SDK enum also accepts `"LOCAL_FILES"` and `"DATA_SOURCE"` (singular) which work in practice — keep all three.
8. **MCP tools endpoint** (`/mcp/tools`) is not in the published spec. Treat as undocumented / legacy; new agent creation should not depend on it.
9. **Search wire format**: request body is `{"text": "...", "top_k": N, "similarity_cutoff": F}`; response body is `{"chunks": [{origin_name, origin_ref, document_id, score, media_type, text}]}`. Our SDK keeps Python field names `query` / `top_n` and accepts both `chunks` and legacy `hits` responses via `serialization_alias` + a before-validator. Don't break that wrapping.
10. **Per-index DELETE endpoint** is undocumented. Deployments may 404/405. SDK raises `IndexDeleteUnsupported` (a `PaisError` subclass) with `suggested_alternatives`. CLI cleanup workflow catches it and offers "Delete parent KB (cascades)" or "Purge --strategy recreate". KB delete (`DELETE /knowledge-bases/{id}`) and Agent delete (`DELETE /agents/{id}`) ARE documented and cascade.
11. **Doc types every status field as `string`** — `model_engine`, `model_type`, `Index.status`, `Indexing.state`, `Document.state`, `data_origin_type`, `IndexRefreshPolicy.policy_type`, `ToolLink.link_type`, `DataSource.type`. Our SDK uses `str` for these (Enum classes kept as named constants: `ModelEngine.VLLM == "VLLM"`). Don't revert them to Enum-typed — it crashes on unknown values like `LLAMA_CPP`.
12. **No `/health` endpoint documented.** Reachability check uses HEAD on the base URL — any HTTP response (incl. 4xx/5xx) means TCP+TLS work.
13. **No server-side log endpoint documented.** Logs are client-side only (`~/.pais/logs/pais.log`, rotating). `pais doctor` collates everything for support.

## Tooling

- `uv` for env + scripts. Install all extras: `uv sync --all-extras`.
- Lint + format: `ruff` (config in `pyproject.toml`).
- Type-check: `mypy` strict on `src/`.
- Tests: `pytest`. Several tests spin up uvicorn against the mock; that's normal.
- Splitter token counts use HuggingFace `tokenizers` (optional `[dev]` extra).

## Standard commands

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
uv run ruff check
uv run ruff format --check       # use `uv run ruff format` to fix
uv run mypy src
uv run pytest -q
uv run pytest --cov=src/pais -q  # with coverage

# troubleshooting
pais doctor                      # one-shot diagnostic probe battery
pais logs path                   # where's the log file?
pais logs tail -n 50             # last 50 lines
pais -v                          # shell with full INFO logs
```

## Release / publish ritual (followed for v0.1–v0.6.5; keep doing this)

1. Branch: `git checkout -b feat/<short-name>` (or `fix/…`, `chore/…`).
2. Make changes. Add tests. Update docs (every user-facing change → README + CHANGELOG).
3. Local gates must pass: `ruff check && ruff format --check && mypy src && pytest -q`.
4. Bump the version in **two places**: `pyproject.toml` `[project] version` AND `src/pais/__init__.py` `__version__` (they MUST match — `pip install --upgrade` silently no-ops if the version doesn't increase).
5. CHANGELOG: add a new top section at the top. **Breaking changes get an explicit `### ⚠️ Breaking changes` header.**
6. Commit with conventional subject (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`). Include the `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>` trailer.
7. Push branch + open PR with `gh pr create`. PR body has Summary + Test plan checklist.
8. Watch CI: `gh pr checks <num> --repo dshahnaz/pais-sdk-cli --watch`. Must be green on 3.10/3.11/3.12 before merge.
9. Squash-merge: `gh pr merge <num> --repo dshahnaz/pais-sdk-cli --squash --delete-branch`.
10. Sync main: `git checkout main && git pull`.
11. Tag: `git tag -a v<X.Y.Z> -m "v<X.Y.Z> — <one-line summary>"` then `git push origin v<X.Y.Z>`.
12. GitHub release: `gh release create v<X.Y.Z> --title "..." --notes "..."`. For breaking-change releases, put the migration call-out at the **top** of the notes.

After release, users upgrade via:
```bash
pip install --upgrade "git+https://github.com/dshahnaz/pais-sdk-cli.git@v<X.Y.Z>"
```

## Conventions enforced in code

- `from __future__ import annotations` on every module (we support Python 3.10+).
- `pais.dev.*` is **legacy / internal**. New code goes in `pais.ingest.*` or `pais.cli.*`. Don't add new public surface to `pais.dev`.
- New CLI commands live in their own file under `pais.cli/<name>_cmd.py` and get wired in `app.py`. Use module-level `typer.Option` constants to satisfy ruff B008.
- New splitters: subclass with `kind: ClassVar[str]`, `options_model: ClassVar[type[BaseModel]]`, `__init__(options)`, `split(path) -> Iterator[SplitDoc]`, `group_key(path) -> str`. Register with `@register_splitter`. Add a row to the table in README + `docs/ingestion.md`.
- Destructive CLI ops require `--yes`/`-y` AND prompt on TTY; refuse non-TTY without `--yes`.
- Every alias-accepting command goes through `_resolve_kb` / `_resolve_index` — UUIDs pass through, declared aliases resolve to UUIDs (cached at `~/.pais/aliases.json`).
- TOML config validation errors must point at the exact TOML path. Use pydantic models in `_profile_config.py`; never raw dicts.
- Logs are structured JSON via `pais.logging`. Secrets (`password`, `authorization`, `access_token`, …) are auto-redacted. Log lines must include `request_id`.

## Mock server (use this for any local testing)

```bash
uv run python -m pais_mock --port 8080 &
export PAIS_MODE=http
export PAIS_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1
export PAIS_AUTH=none
pais kb list
```

Or set `PAIS_MODE=mock` (no HTTP, in-process `FakeTransport`). Settings precedence: CLI flag > env > `~/.pais/config.toml` profile > defaults.

## How to plan / propose changes

- **Step 0 (load-bearing)**: For any plan touching PAIS API endpoints — KBs, indexes, agents, chat, search, MCP, embeddings, models, data sources — the very first action is `WebFetch` of <https://developer.broadcom.com/xapis/vmware-private-ai-service-api/latest/>. Cross-check `AgentCreate`, `KnowledgeBaseCreate`, `IndexCreate`, search, and chat shapes against the live spec. Only then start the 5-phase plan workflow. The two times this was skipped (v0.4 chunk_size units, v0.6 agent `index_id`) cost a release cycle each.
- For any non-trivial change: enter Plan Mode, write the plan to `~/.claude/plans/<plan>.md`, include a **Safety review** section (risks → mitigations) and a **flat one-line-per-task TODO** at the end.
- Plans are also copied into `docs/<feature>-plan.md` for the repo when the user asks.

## What NOT to do

- **Don't start a plan that touches PAIS endpoints without a fresh WebFetch of the doc URL** — past misses (chunk_size units, agent `index_id` shape) each cost a release cycle. The SDK can drift from the spec; the doc is authoritative.
- Don't bump only `pyproject.toml` and forget `__init__.py` (or vice versa) — `pip install --upgrade` will silently no-op.
- Don't put secrets in `pais.toml` — the loader rejects `password`, `client_secret`, `bearer_token` at parse time.
- Don't false-positive `--replace` matches: each splitter owns its `group_key`. Runner does `origin_name.startswith(group_key)`. Convention: most splitters end `group_key` with `__`; `passthrough` uses the full filename for exact match.
- Don't `pais kb ensure --prune` casually — it deletes server-side resources not in the TOML. `--yes` plus per-item TTY confirmation gate is mandatory.
- Don't hand-edit the alias cache `~/.pais/aliases.json` — use `pais alias clear` instead.

## When in doubt

Read the latest plan in `docs/v0.4-plan.md`, then `docs/ingestion.md`, then `docs/architecture.md`. The plan files include rationale and trade-offs that aren't repeated in code comments.
